# RPG-Game-Project
How to see my Game Project :
## 1 - Clone the repository 
‘‘‘bash
git clone https://github.com/Caotox/RPG-Game-Project
‘‘‘
## 2 - Get Unity (2022.3.50f1 or ulterior)

## 3 - Click on "Add project from disk", and select the repository you clonned 

## 4 - You're good to go ! 
Just remember this is not the final version, and that I'm currently working on it (as for the story, if you are interested, i suggest you go look at my RPG Maker MZ Game, as in my final project, the two games are gonna be linked)
