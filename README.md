How to See My RPG Maker MZ Game Project

# 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caotox/RPG-Game-Project
```
# 2. Install RPG Maker MZ
You may need to pay for that.

# 3. Launch RPG Maker MZ
Then, click "Open Project", and select the .mz file

# 4. You're Good to Go! 
Please note that:

This is not the final version of the game.
I am actively working on improvements and updates.
For insights into the story, I recommend checking out my Unity game ("Git Game Project Repository"), as both projects are intended to be narratively linked.
